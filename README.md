# [ChromeXt](https://github.com/JingMatrix/ChromeXt)

Add UserScript and DevTools supports to Chromium based and WebView based browsers using Xposed framework.

*Note*: this repo is only for uploading Xposed Modules releases, the orginal project is [ChromeXt](https://github.com/JingMatrix/ChromeXt).

##  How does it work?

We hook the `onUpdateUrl` function in [UserScript.kt](app/src/main/java/org/matrix/chromext/hook/UserScript.kt),
add URL comparison there and evaluate JavaScript using the `javascript:` scheme.

Chromium based browsers,
[Bromite](https://github.com/bromite/bromite),
[Thorium](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium),
[Mulch](https://gitlab.com/divested-mobile/mulch),
and [Brave](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser) are also fully supported.
Due to different design ideas, supports for the following browsers are not perfect:
1. [Egde](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/download), `DevTools` front end is removed by its authors;
2. [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/en/android/), `Developer options` menu is removed by its authors.

Most WebView based browsers are also supported, if not, please report it.

## Usage

Currently, this project requires **Xposed framework** installed.

For root users, install [LSPosed](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed) first,
pick up the latest built APK from my repo's [GitHub Action](https://github.com/JingMatrix/ChromeXt/actions) and install it.

For non-root users,
I modify a bit [LSPatch](https://github.com/JingMatrix/LSPatch) to support `ChromeXt`; here is how to use it:
1. Download the latest `lspatch-release` from my [Github Action](https://github.com/JingMatrix/LSPatch/actions).
2. Download the latest `ChromeXt.apk` from my [Github Action](https://github.com/JingMatrix/ChromeXt/actions).
3. Extract previously downloaded files to get files `lspatch.jar` (with some suffix) and `ChromeXt-signed.apk`.
4. Patch your APK (taking `arm64_ChromePublic.apk` as example) using the following command: `java -jar lspatch.jar arm64_ChromePublic.apk -d -v -m ChromeXt-signed.apk --force`. If `java` environment is not available, consider using the provided `manager` APK.
5. Install the patched APK, which might require you to first uninstall the one on your phone.

The author uploads releases to [Xposed-Modules-Repo](https://github.com/Xposed-Modules-Repo/org.matrix.chromext/releases) when needed, but not that frequently.

You can then install UserScripts from popular sources: URLs that ends with `.user.js`.
However, this fails for scripts from some domains like `raw.githubusercontent.com`.
For them, one can download those scripts using the download button on the top of Chrome's three dot menu, and
then open your downloaded scripts in Chrome. The installation prompt should show up again.
Alternatively, it is possible to use the `Install UserScript` page menu if you simply want to install it
without further editing.


### Supported API

Currently, ChromeXt supports almost all [Tampermonkey APIs](https://www.tampermonkey.net/documentation.php?locale=en):

1. @name (colons and backslashes not allowed), @namespace (backslashes not allowed), @description and so on
2. @match (must present and conform to the [Chrome Standard](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/match_patterns/))
3. @include = @match, @exclude
4. @run-at: document-start, document-end, document-idle (the default and fallback value)
5. @grant GM_addStyle, GM_addElement, GM_xmlhttpRequest, GM_openInTab, GM_registerMenuCommand (`Resources` panel of eruda), GM_unregisterMenuCommand, GM_download, unsafeWindow (= window)
6. @require, @resource (Without [Subresource Integrity](https://www.tampermonkey.net/documentation.php#api:Subresource_Integrity))

These APIs are implemented differently from the official ones, see the source file [LocalScripts.kt](app/src/main/java/org/matrix/chromext/script/LocalScripts.kt) if you have doubts or questions.

### UserScripts manager front end

To manage scripts installed by `ChromeXt`, here are a simple front end hosted on [github.io](https://jingmatrix.github.io/ChromeXt/) and two mirrors of it (in case that you have connection issues): [onrender.com](https://jianyu-ma.onrender.com/ChromeXt/), [netlify.app](https://jianyu-ma.netlify.app/ChromeXt/).

### Edit scripts before installing them

If you cancel the prompt of installing a new UserScript, then you can edit it directly in Chrome.
Use the `Install UserScript` page menu to install your modified UserScript.

### Limitations

A valid UserScript fails if the following two conditions hold _at the same time_:

1. The matched website has disabled `script-src 'unsafe-eval';` by [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP);
2. The script size is nearly 2M.

To deal with this extremely rare case, one should
```
use multiple scripts of normal sizes instead of a giant script
```

### DevTools for developers

From three dots page menu, ChromeXt offers you
1. `Developer tools` in the UserScript manager front end,
2. `Eruda console` in other pages.

For `Edge` browser, these menus are moved to the page info menu,
which locates at the left corner inside the URL input bar.

For WebView based browsers, these menu items are presented in the context menu.

## Bonus

Since WebView based browsers have no unified designs, the following
first four features are not supported for them.

### Open in Chrome

The application `ChromeXt` is able to
1. received shared texts to search them online,
2. open JavaScript files to install them as UserScripts.

The reversed priority order of opening which Chromium based browsers is given in [AndroidManifest.xml](app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml).

### Solution of system gesture conflicts

The history forward gesture of Chrome is now available near the vertical center of screen.
On other areas, only the system gesture is available.
One can disable it through the `Developer options` menu.
(Tap seven times on the Chrome version from the Chrome settings, you will see the `Developer options` menu.)

### Enable reader mode manually

ChromeXt adds a book icon in the page menu to enable reader (distiller) mode manually.

This function is not available in `Brave` browser for unknown reason.

### Export browser bookmarks

Bookmarks can be exported in HTML format through the `Developer options` menu.

### AD Blocker solution

For blocking network requests, I recommend to use `AdAway` or any proxy AD Blocker such as `clash`.

A content cosmetic blocker is embedded into ChromeXt with the help of eruda.
Open the `Eruda console`.
In the `Elements` panel, one can use the `pointer` icon to select elements on the page.
After clicking the `delete` icon for a selected element, a corresponding filter will be saved to the `Resources` panel,
where one can manage previous added filters.
These filters are saved in the browser even after clearing the site's data.

Another way to block ADs is using the [Content-Security-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src) to block some scripts from loading.
See the official [Content-Security-Policy Blocker](app/src/main/assets/CSP.user.js) UserScript.

### User-Agent spoofing

One can edit the User-Agent from the `Info` panel of `Eruda console`.
A valid User-Agent should contain only ASCII characters.
Currently, ChromeXt only changes the `User-Agent` HTTP header, which
works well but is [deprecated](https://wicg.github.io/ua-client-hints/#user-agent).

For Chromium based browsers, when the User-Agent spoofing is not taking effects, refresh the page using the reload button in the page menu.
(By contrast, a swipe refresh might be insufficient.)

Note that the DevTools can also change User-Agent.
